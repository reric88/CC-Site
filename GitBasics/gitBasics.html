    <h1>Git Basics</h1>
    <p><b>Git</b> is a type of source control software. This program allows us to create folders and files, among other things, which we can use to build our web-pages, sites, applications, programs and more.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Source control software</b> enables a user to record their progress and keep all their changes, similar to looking back at your footprints. If you are adamant about keeping up with your changes, they will all be there for you to refer back on and fix any mistakes you may have made if a change doesn't go as expected. You can always roll back to a previous state of your content.</p>
    <br>
    <p>With source control software, you will control two "directories" of your source. These are called repositories. One is a <b>remote repository</b>, which is kept in a location specified on the internet. Github is a popular option. Your other is your <b>local repository</b>, which is the source on your own physical machine, or the one you are working with.</p>
    <br>
    <p>We learned that whenever you begin using git, it is a good idea to run two specific commands to create your profile to "sign" your repositories with:</p>
    <p><b>$ git config --global user.name "John Doe"</b> (Your own name will replace John Doe as the author, the quotations remain)</p>
    <p><b>$ git config --global user.email "youremail@domain.com"</b> (Your own email will replace youremail@domain.com as the authors email address. The quotations remain here as well.)</p>
    <br>
    <p>There are many git commands which can be viewed by typing <b>$ git help</b>. There will be a handful which you will use on a regular basis. These are listed below.</p>
    <p><b>$ git init</b> creates your local repository in your "root" folder specified. All sub-folders inside the root folder will be included in your repository. This command creates your .git file which stores all your logged changes and file structure.</p>
    <p><b>$ git add filename</b> or <b>$ git add .</b> adds your current file(s) and folder(s) to your repository. "git add ." will add all files and folders created, whereas a specific filename will only add that file or folder. </p>
    <p><b>$ git commit -m "</b>comments for commit<b>"</b> will add all changes to your files to your repository. This is what records your progress as you complete projects.</p>
    <p><b>$ git push</b> will "push" your local repository to your remote repository. This cannot be used without first creating your remote repository, which will remain empty until you fill it with your local. There are a few ways to do this, either through your remote repository hosts website, or through your terminal if you have the correct languages installed.</p>

    <p>An example of what your git commands will consist of with a new directory are as follows:</p>
    <p><b>$ git init</b></p> to initialize your repository.
    <p><b></b></p>
    <p><b></b></p>
    <p><b></b></p>
    <p><b></b></p>
